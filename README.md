Encryption:
This Bash script is designed to securely encrypt files using the AES-256-CBC encryption algorithm provided by OpenSSL. It offers a user-friendly approach by prompting the user to enter the full path of the file they wish to encrypt and a custom password. Upon successful encryption, the script generates a new file with a .enc extension, ensuring the original data remains protected.
The script is particularly useful for users who need a lightweight, command-line-based solution to safeguard sensitive files before storage or transmission. It follows standard encryption practices and includes basic error handling to alert users if the specified file is not found or if encryption fails. With a focus on simplicity and security, this tool is ideal for students, developers, or system administrators who want to implement basic file encryption in their workflows without relying on third-party applications.


Decryption:
This Bash script offers a simple, secure, and interactive command-line tool for encrypting and decrypting files using the AES-256-CBC algorithm via OpenSSL. It features a user-friendly menu system that allows users to select between encrypting a file, decrypting an encrypted .enc file, or exiting the program.
For encryption, the script prompts for a file path and password, then creates a securely encrypted output with a .enc extension. For decryption, it asks for the encrypted file and the password, then restores the original content to a new decrypted file. Error handling ensures that invalid file paths or incorrect passwords are managed gracefully.
Ideal for students, developers, and system administrators, this lightweight utility provides a practical solution for securing sensitive files without the need for external applications. Its menu-based design makes it easy to use even for those with minimal scripting experience
